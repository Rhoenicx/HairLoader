HairLoader mod aims to add a way for other mods to easily add custom hairstyles to Terraria.

- Contains new Hair UI for the Stylist
- Add hairstyles through mod calls
- Add custom currency with item ID's
- Specify the price of the hairstyle and the color
- Choose if the style is available in the character creator
- Add custom unlock conditions (Requires a mod call on the mod that added the hairstyle)

Currently the mod uses On.Terraria on a couple of player drawlayers for the custom hairstyles to show up, this may break mods.
Future plans is to do this by adding new playerlayers and hiding/disabling the vanilla ones.
