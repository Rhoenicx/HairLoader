HairLoader creates the possibility for other mods to add custom hairstyles to the game using Mod Calls.

Current features:
- Replaces the Stylist's NPC hairwindow with a custom hairwindow UI.
- Hairwindow is sorted based on mod name.
- Custom currency support by specifying the item's ID.
- Option to specify the price of the hairstyle and re-color.
- Option to add the Hairstyle to the character creation window.
- Option to add custom unlock conditions (requires additional Mod Calls on the Mod that added the hairstyle)
- Utilizes a custom way to save the selected hair, based on mod (class) name and hair name.
- Reverts the players last selected vanilla hair if the custom hairstyle is not present (for example disabled the mod).
- HairOffset value for the X offset, this way you can move the hair along the X-axis (useful for hairstyles that exceed the vanilla hair texture width)

Limitations for other mods, any mod that modifies the following methods or has an On.Terraria call on:
- On.Terraria.GameContent.UI.States.UICharacterCreation.MakeHairsylesMenu
- On.Terraria.DataStructures.PlayerDrawLayers.DrawPlayer_01_BackHair
- On.Terraria.DataStructures.PlayerDrawLayers.DrawPlayer_21_Head

These limitations are present because I use a detour to run my custom code. For obvious reasons I do not call origin / return. (Maybe in the future I will replace this with custom playerlayers, this is not going to affect any mods)

Vist the github page for the mod call code examples to add hairstyles using this mod. (Open HairLoader.cs)
