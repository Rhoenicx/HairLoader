HairLoader mod for Terraria 1.4

This mod acts as a framework for other mods to add their custom hairstyles to the game using simple Mod Calls.

Current features:
- Replaces the Stylist's NPC hairwindow with a custom hairwindow UI.
- Hairwindow is sorted based on mod name(s).
- Custom currency support by specifying the item's ID.
- Option to specify the price of the hairstyle and re-color.
- Option to add the Hairstyle to the character creation window.
- Option to add custom unlock conditions for each hairstyle (requires additional Mod Calls)
- Utilizes a custom way to save the selected hair, based on mod (class) name and hair name.
- Reverts the players last selected vanilla hair if the custom hairstyle is no longer available (e.g. disabled mod).
- Hair offset X to move the hair along the X-axis, useful for hairstyles that exceed the vanilla hair texture width.
- Currently requires spritesheets to be same height as vanilla's.
